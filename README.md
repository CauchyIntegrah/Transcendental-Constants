This repository is where I will share different methods of evaluating different constants in mathematics that abide by the law of transcendentalism[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendental_number] e.g. Euler's number[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_(mathematical_constant)], Euler-Mascheroni Constant[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_constant], Omega constant[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omega_constant].
